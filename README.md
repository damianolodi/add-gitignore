# `add-gitignore`

## Brief Description

The main goal of this script is to automate the creation of a `.gitignore` file for new and existing Git projects. The following assumptions are considered:

1. in a project, multiple users can contribute from different OSs. Both Linux, macOS and Windows are taken into account.
2. Version control can be used also in projects that are not directly code related. The softwares used when working on those kind of projects (e.g. KiCad, freeCAD, ...) can add some particular files that should not be committed into the public repository. 

This second point arise from my personal necessity of avoiding to commit backup files or cache files when working on hardware projects.
