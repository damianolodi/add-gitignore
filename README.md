# add-gitignore

## Brief Description

The main goal of this script is to automate the creation of a `.gitignore` file for new and existing Git projects. The following assumptions are considered:

1. in a project, multiple users can contribute from different OSs. Both Linux, macOS and Windows are taken into account.
2. Version control can be used also in projects that are not directly code related (e.g. _hardware_ projects). The software used when working on those kinds of projects (like _KiCad_ for EDA, _freeCAD_ for CAD, ...) can add some particular files that should not be committed into the public repository.
